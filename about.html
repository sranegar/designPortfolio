                    <h3>Hello, I'm Stephanie! Thank you
                        for being here...</h3>
                    <p>Digital design is my passion. I find myself spending a majority of my time creating and getting lost in projects. I strive for perfection in everything I do and I'm eager to continue to
                        grow my skills every single day. I'm a very open-minded individual who constantly wants to be learning and advancing my skills to become the best full-stack developer possible.
                    </p>
                    <p>I'm a firm believer in not just creating art, but also creating a life you enjoy. I live a very
                        low-key lifestyle that I absolutely love. When I'm not designing, I like to spend my time
                        outdoors or with my friends and family. Although I identify as an introvert, I'm very easy to
                        get along with and can be very social! I enjoy deep conversation and connecting with like-minded
                        people.
                    </p>
                    <p>I pour everything into each design and web project that I create. I become fully immersed and dedicated to the process until it's finished. I believe in the importance of always staying inspired and challenging myself to achieve new goals and become the best human I can possibly be. </p>
